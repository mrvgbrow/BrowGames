<h1>Version 1.0</h1>

<p>BrowGames is a collection of customizable classic games, all coded from scratch in Python. The original versions of most of these games are not playable in emulators because they had no CPU. In addition, BrowGames gives you the freedom to manipulate basic game parameters to see how it changes the gameplay.</p>
By default, BrowGames uses a parameter set that is very similar to the original game, but many other presets are available to experiment with. If you're interested in the historical context on the games included here, as well as details about their implementation, see The Retrogame Deconstruction Zone (https://www.retrogamedeconstructionzone.com).</p>

<p>Please note that not all combinations of parameters will be playable and some will even crash the game. However, BrowGames will revert to the default parameters when you restart, so don't be shy about breaking the game from time to time.</p>
