<h1>Version 1.1</h1>

<p>This program is tunable version of the original Pong (1972). You can adjust the parameters (e.g., paddle size, ball speed) to change the game and experiment with different designs. It is a standalone executable so just remove the old version and replace it with this one.</p>

<p>Please note that not all combinations of parameters will be playable and some will even crash the game. However, it will revert to the default parameters when you restart, so don't be shy about breaking the game from time to time.</p>
